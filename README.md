Certainly! Below is a README detailing the methods and output of the Sudoku solver program.

## Sudoku Solver - README

### Methods

1. **`solveSudoku(int[][] board)`**:
   - This method takes an unsolved Sudoku puzzle represented by a 2D array `board`.
   - It uses the backtracking algorithm to fill in the missing numbers in the puzzle.
   - The method returns `true` if a solution is found, and `false` if no solution exists.

2. **`isValid(int[][] board, int row, int col, int num)`**:
   - This method checks if it's valid to place a number `num` at position `(row, col)` on the Sudoku board `board`.
   - It checks if the same number exists in the current row, column, or 3x3 subgrid.
   - Returns `true` if it's valid to place the number, and `false` otherwise.

3. **`printBoard(int[][] board)`**:
   - This method prints the solved Sudoku board to the console.
   - It takes the solved Sudoku board represented by a 2D array `board` as input.
   - Prints each row of the board, separating the 3x3 subgrids with an empty line.

### Output

Upon running the Sudoku solver program, it will display the solved Sudoku puzzle if a solution exists. The output will look like this:

```
Sudoku puzzle solved successfully:
5 3 4 6 7 8 9 1 2 
6 7 2 1 9 5 3 4 8 
1 9 8 3 4 2 5 6 7 

8 5 9 7 6 1 4 2 3 
4 2 6 8 5 3 7 9 1 
7 1 3 9 2 4 8 5 6 

9 6 1 5 3 7 2 8 4 
2 8 7 4 1 9 6 3 5 
3 4 5 2 8 6 1 7 9 
```

Each number represents a cell in the Sudoku grid, with zeros indicating empty cells. The solved Sudoku grid is printed row by row, with each 3x3 subgrid separated by an empty line for better visualization.
